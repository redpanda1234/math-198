Outline of talk

Intro:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

+ How can I, a student of pure mathematics, make an impact on society?
  - What is "pure" mathematics?
  - The question we want to identify first: what is pure math "good" for?

+ Quote: "Pure mathematics, may it never be of any use to anybody"
  - Quote presents a false dichotomy between "utility" and "applications"
  - Def. of utility: "the state of being useful, profitable, or beneficial."
  - What is the utility of pure math?

+ Math as a vehicle for meaning (or something)
  - What math can afford: curiosity, perspective, empowerment, and community.
  - Prof. Su's _Mathematics for Human Flourishing_
  - In some sense: opportunity should be an inviolable right
  - Striving to deliver this equitably to all people

+ The goal: level the disparity between what math _can_ accomplish and what it
  _does_ accomplish currently.

The problem:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

+ The process of learning mathematics
  - Practice, experience >> talent
  - Problem solving as training of the subconscious

+ The efficacy of current public education in this respect
  - Math classes are often traumatic experiences
  - My famous quote from precalc: "Forest, I think your biggest problem is
    really that you're just not as smart as you think you are. And the sooner
    you stop trying to change that and learn to accept it, the better for all of
    us."
  - Hearing that as a student: shocking.
  - Getting the opportunity to rebuild and moving on: largely based on
    _opportunity_ and privilege

+ The leaky pipeline
  - Implicit bias & Discrimination
  - Socio-economic limitations to pursuing doctoral studies, and beyond


Moving forward
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

+ "Freedom is nothing but a chance to be better." -Albert Camus
  - The impact I want to have: understand the problem, and fight back against
    it.
  - My position: fight against the negative experiences that _I_ know.

+ Challenges
  - It's multifaceted
  - There are deep societal undercurrents at play
  - Palliative measure: aim to fight trauma in mathematics through better
    instruction

+ Two major points of focus: quality of instruction _and_ accessibility of said
  instruction.
  - Dual role of a teacher:
    + The teacher as an instructor
    + The teacher as a source of inspiration
  - In short: aim not just for mastery of material, but also for fundamental
    desire to know.

# This might be a bit too much material; possibly just summarize the bullet
# points below
+ The role of the instructor
  - Inherently one of dynamism and adaptability
  - Good teaching: identifying the exact point of failure in a student's
    understanding
    + Autonomously vs. non-autonomously rectifiable misunderstandings
      - Former: instructor should intervene, latter: instructor should guide
        student to answer
    + Proper implementation of IBL: a balance of both

+ The role of inspiration
  - Quote by Antoine de Saint-Exupery
  - Towards: beauty, elegance, and more.
  - Autonomous process of learning

+ Conclusion:
