Hello everybody. Today I'd like to talk to you about the impact I hope to have
on society. This is something very important and personal to me, and I'm really
happy to be getting a chance to talk about it today. Let's hope I do it justice.

Anyways, let's get right into it. I'd like to begin by addressing the elephant
in the room:

*  NEXT SLIDE  *

As some of you might know, I am a math major. Not a math-CS major, not a
math-physics major --- just a plain, honest-to-goodness math major. In
particular, my interests lie in _pure_ math, not applied math. Generally
speaking, I'm not very interested in real-world problems. This raises a
question: how, then, can I hope hope to have an impact on society, if pure math
is "never of any use to anybody?"

Well, simply put, I just I don't think pure math _is_ of no use to anybody. The
quote presents a false dichotomy: namely, that in order to have societal
utility, a thing has to have real-world applications. But there are plenty of
counterexamples here. For instance, it's hard to suggest that Literature, Music,
or the Arts have any "real-world applications," and yet we don't think of them
as "useless," because they contribute positively to the human experience. I
believe math can do the same.

At its best, it affords many things that people love. Cool ideas to puzzle over,
different ways of seeing the world, and involvement in a vibrant community. The
issue is that most people never get a chance to interact with math in this way.

Access to "higher math" is gated in many subtle ways by facets of class and
privilege. There are many problems here, but I'll just focus on two big ones:
the accessibility of good materials, and the prevalence of "traumatic"
experiences in math education.

  + The first is fairly self-explanatory: although resources like KhanAcademy,
    Wikipedia, and 3Blue1Brown are making free, high-quality math information
    more accessible day by day, there's still a long way to go before they can
    achieve parity with a well-taught brick-and-mortar class. This
    systematically disadvantages students who lack exposure such resources.

  + Second, for many people, math classes are traumatic. I'm always shocked at
    how consistently people say things like "I was always terrible at math" when
    I tell them what I study. This is a horrifying pathology of our education
    system: I can think of no other subject that, upon just being _mentioned_
    causes people such intense feelings of panic and shame.

    In my personal experience, this has a lot to do with how classes and
    teachers define success. I don't usually talk about this, but in high
    school, math was actually my worst subject (by _far_). I particularly
    remember a PreCalc test where, despite studying for _hours_ and _hours_, I
    scored just a 54%. When I got my exam back, I went to my teacher's office
    after school and asked her for help. I told her I thought I understood
    things in class, but just couldn't perform on our tests. Eventually, she got
    impatient and snapped at me, saying this

*  NEXT SLIDE  *

    Hearing that as a student was absolutely devestating. I remember just how
    _factual_ it felt. It wasn't personal --- I simply wasn't good at math. The
    tests showed that. My teacher, who had seen hundreds of students before me,
    told me that. How could I possibly know better than she did? Why should I
    believe in myself over her?

  + I'm going to gloss over a lot details that aren't directly relevant for my
    talk, but the gist is that I was given a big second change, and eventually
    improved. But to this day, I'm shocked by how easy it would have been for
    things to go differently. As an asian-american male, toxic stereotypes
    actually worked in my favor here, asserting that I really _should_ be be
    good at math. What if I were not from a privileged group, and instead had to
    push past barriers of identity as well? How many potentially excited
    students does our field lose each year because of this?

  + It's hard to say for sure. But one need only glance at demographic
    information for mathematicians at the undergraduate, graduate, and
    postdoctoral levels to see that they become increasingly skewed towards
    white and asian men at every step.

*  NEXT SLIDE  *

  + So: where do I go from here? As I said before, I think that my privileges
    were instrumental in moving past what my teacher said. I was lucky in many,
    many ways. And this upsets me. I hate the idea of serendipity playing such a
    large role in who gets a chance to learn. This is what I want to change.
    This is what I feel I've been given a chance to fight. I want to be an
    educator. And I want to be better.

  + Of course, this is a hugely complex issue. There are deep societal
    undercurrents here that require supra-institutional organization to combat.
    But on a local scale, teachers have the biggest opportunity to effect
    change. They have the power not only to shape _what_ people think, but _how_
    they think as well.
