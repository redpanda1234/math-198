So, as some of you might know, I am a math major. Not a math-CS major, not a
math-physics major --- just a plain, honest-to-goodness math major. If I had to
categorize myself further, I'd say I consider my interests to lie in _pure_ math
rather than applied math, but the particular labeling is not terribly important:
the idea is mainly that I'm just not generally interested in real-world
problems. This begs a question: how, then, can I possibly have an impact on
society?

There's a famous quote in this vein, sometimes attributed to Henry John Stephen
Smith, but not reliably recorded anywhere: "Here's to pure mathematics --- may
it never be of any use to anybody."

This reflects a belief I feel I encounter frequently when talking with people
about math. Namely that Math is "useless," and somehow, this is something to be
celebrated.

* SLIGHT PAUSE *
*  NEXT SLIDE  *

I want to push back on this. Math can't _really_ be "useless," or else nobody
would bother to study it. The mistake is in thinking that utility comes only
from having real-world applications.

// yikes remove this

// But there are plenty of pursuits we value that lack such affects. Why else

// concerns never enter the mind there. So too it is with math.
