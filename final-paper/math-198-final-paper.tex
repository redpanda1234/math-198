\begin{problem}[Prompt]
  Write a 750-1000 word reflective essay about your growth as a
  speaker in Math Forum. Successful essays will incorporate specific
  examples of lessons learned, together with accompanying allusions to
  your own talks as evidence. Readers of your essay should easily be
  able to sense the extent to which you have been engaged in Math
  Forum.\\

  Please note that the audience for your essay is primarily your
  instructor, but every member of the mathematics faculty should be
  able to read (and enjoy) your essay. Finally, to submit your essay,
  please upload a PDF copy of your essay to your drop box, and please
  name your file lastname-essay.pdf.

\begin{solution}[Response.]
  \setlength{\parindent}{2em}

  I've really enjoyed my time in Math Forum. I've learned a lot about
  public speaking, managing my verbal/physical tics, and presenting
  technical information in a non-interactive setting. Honestly, I wish
  there were a sequel course --- I'd be really excited to try my hand
  at a full-hour lecture, or something like that. I guess I could
  always try making YouTube videos or something\ldots but yeah,
  anyways, here are some of my big takeaways from the class:
  \begin{enumerate}[label=\arabic*)]
    \item I find non-technical talks much harder than technical talks.
      This was a huge surprise for me.
    \item Giving a talk is a very different experience from presenting
      material in an interactive setting (e.g.\ tutoring). In the
      latter, you can sometimes rely on your audience to signal where
      you need to slow down, what you need to make clearer, and so on.
      Because talks are more static and non-interactive, you have to
      put in a \emph{lot} of work ahead-of-time to identify places
      where your audience could get lost.
    \item Knowing how to explain a topic well is \emph{not} the same
      thing as knowing how to give a good presentation on it. The
      latter requires a lot more work, including (but not limited to)
      \begin{enumerate}
        \item doing extensive meta-analysis of your own understanding
          of the subject,
        \item compressing that understanding into an easily-digestible
          model that you want to communicate to your audience, and
        \item finding ways to efficiently translate that model to
          words, pictures, and any other medium of communication.
      \end{enumerate}
  \end{enumerate}
  I'll offer some brief thoughts about the first two points, and focus
  the remainder of this essay on the third.
  \section{Why is non-technical exposition harder?}
  I was pretty shocked by how much I struggled with the non-technical
  talks. A priori, I had assumed that it'd be \emph{easier} to speak
  about non-technical subject, for a number of reasons:
  \begin{enumerate}[label=(\roman*)]
    \item There's less jargon/conceptual scaffolding that you need to
      provide to get your audience primed.
    \item Non-technical topics are closer to what people interact with
      on an everyday basis.
    \item People have told me I'm a good storyteller. I thought this
      would translate particularly well into non-technical exposition.
  \end{enumerate}
  In reality, I found that my non-technical talks tended to be
  rushed, rambly, unfocused, and a bit overwhelming. Speed was a
  particular concern, as evidenced by my feedback forms (all of the
  following are from talk 1):
  \begin{itemize}
    \item ``The talking speed was a little fast to make it hard to
      follow [\ldots] It seemed to be just a blob of information at
      times[\ldots]''
    \item ``Forest was very fast, which disrupted the flow of the talk
      [\ldots]''
    \item ``Sometimes I had a hard time understanding some of the
      words you were saying which I think was mainly due to the speed
      of your talking as well as your tone.''
    \item ``I didn't know where you were actually going at times,
      which made it feel like I was doing more work to keep track of
      what was going on.''
  \end{itemize}
  For the speed part: I think a big contributing factor here was that
  I simply wasn't used to conveying narrative in a 5-minute time
  frame. But I think a bigger issue was structural. In these talks, I
  had a really hard time figuring out how to order things, as well as
  where/when to emphasize transitions, and so on. Without an explicit
  structure to follow, I resorted to throwing a high volume of
  information at the audience with the expectation that they'd be able
  to piece it together themselves.

  So what makes the technical talk different? Essentially, I think
  that the rigidity of my definitions did a lot of ``work'' in
  determining the overall structure of the talk. But that's a story
  for \S 3\ldots


  % I hadn't realized how much ``work'' my definitions do to
  % structure my talking when I'm


  % is that things are a lot less discretized. This makes it
  % easy to continue packing more and more stuff into your talk, so that
  % the audience has an easier time interpolating the underlying
  % surface.

  % Idea: concepts as $n$-surfaces. Educator: necessarily gives a few
  % key points to allow interpolation. Sampling rate ought to be
  % proportional to how furrowed the surface is, maybe?

  \section{Why is talk different}

  \section{How to make a talk accessible and/or engaging}

  Key: everything should be justified and motivated. Problem should
  always seem like path of least resistance has been taken. Need to
  \emph{justify} to the audience why we've done stuff.

  The key in a good talk is to focus on polishing the intro and
  conclusion. The technical details are certainly important, but
  provided the audience has a good understanding of the big-picture,
  they'll ultimately be secondary --- with a large-scale perspective,
  audience can reacquire whatever knowledge they need at some point in
  the future.

  Most audiences are surprisingly capable of grappling with abstract
  technical material, provided it's \emph{interesting}. This is what
  you have to focus on. Motivate everything, make everything feel
  gratifying and sensible, and so on.

  Problem is \emph{not} quite ``people aren't great at abstract
  reasoning.'' People do plenty of abstract reasoning --- it's a very
  human thing, in fact. The problem is that abstraction is often
  \emph{uninteresting} to people. Evolutionarily, this would make
  sense, maybe. I really am not an evolutionary psychologist, but I
  imagine that if you were part of a hunter-gatherer society, it
  wouldn't be beneficial to get caught up in ruminations about the
  universe.
